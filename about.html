        <p class="p1">A cloud kitchen—also referred to as a “ghost kitchen” or “virtual kitchen”—is a commercial kitchen space that provides food businesses the facilities and services needed to prepare menu items for delivery and takeout. Unlike traditional brick-and-mortar locations, cloud kitchens allow food businesses to create and deliver food products with minimal overhead.Recent data indicates that meal delivery orders increased by more than 150% from 2019 to 2020—and UBS anticipates the food delivery market to increase more than 10x over a ten-year period from $35 billion per year to $365 billion. More and more restaurant owners and food entrepreneurs are turning to cloud kitchens as an ideal business solution to capture this increase in food delivery demand.Curious about cloud kitchens and want to find out more? The below guide provides an overview of cloud kitchens and the growing list of reasons to make cloud kitchens a part of your business’s growth strategy.</p>

       <h2 class="kol1"> Who Uses Cloud Kitchens?</h2>

       <p class="klo"> Beloved local restaurants to name-brand national chains—are quickly turning to cloud kitchens as the ideal solution to expand their business. Here are a few business types that are incorporating ghost kitchens into their growth strategy.Delivery-Optimized Restaurants: Delivery-optimized cloud kitchens allow you to accommodate orders without added overhead or hassle. Cloud kitchen-based restaurants use online food delivery platforms (e.g. DoorDash, Postmates and UberEats) or their own white-label platform to source orders and facilitate delivery logistics. Consumers then order through mobile devices and have food delivered to their home or office.Caterers: Own a catering company and need a private kitchen and plenty of cold and dry storage without breaking the bank? Cloud kitchens are an ideal solution.Meal Prep Companies: Meal prep companies often need kitchen space for only a few days a week. Virtual kitchens can provide you this flexibility.Packaged Food Producers: Cloud kitchens can provide ample warehouse space and equipment for packaged food producers to scale.Food Product Testing: A cloud kitchen is a low-risk, low-capital solution that allows your company to market test new food products and brand concepts.</p>
